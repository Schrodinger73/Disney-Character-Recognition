# Disney-Character-Recognition

The sie limitation of GitHub has prevented me from uploading X.npy and Y.npy, and the data I have used. The data can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayehkargari/disney-characters-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayehkargari/princess-dataset, and a bit of cleaning;)
The model is stored under disney_model.keras, so if you just want to test the model without spending time training, you can directly load it. I also tried out some trial images under the folder trial_images to see how well it worked. I put Ariel and Pooh to test the accuracy of the model, and added a few images of some famous singers to see which Disney character they resembled. 
If you don't want to run the code, or use a notebook, you can diretly see the running of the code using the pdf Files folder, which has the pdf and html format of the notebook, with the outputs.

## Enjoy:)
